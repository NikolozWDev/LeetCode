        <p class="text-gray-600 text-[16px]">Reports on the following classes of vulnerability are eligible for reward,
             unless they are excluded (see the next section). In most cases, we will
              only reward the type of vulnerabilities that are listed below.

        <p class="text-gray-600 text-[16px]">The following reports are not considered as vulnerabilities or

        <p class="text-black font-bold text-[18px] mt-[40px]">Ineligible vulnerability types</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 text-[16px]">Leetcode does not consider the following to be eligible vulnerabilities under this program:
            </p>

        <ul class="text-[15px] text-gray-500 ml-[20px]">
            <li>O Denial of Service</li>
            <li>O Social Engineering, including phishing</li>
            <li>O Failure to implement security best practices such as rate limiting, minimum password strength</li>
            <li>O Any issue that can only be exploited by physical access to someone's device or debug access being enabled, or that depends on a vulnerability in the operating system</li>
            <li>O Architectural decisions knowingly made by Leetcode are not considered as valid submissions to the whitehat program even if there may be a more secure alternative configuration.
                 In general, issues that fall in this category will be rejected if we do not plan to implement a fix for them</li>
        </ul>





        <p class="text-black font-bold text-[18px] mt-[40px]">Rules for participation</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 text-[16px]">The following rules must be followed in order to get any rewards:
            </p>

        <ul class="text-[15px] text-gray-500 ml-[20px]">
            <li>O Don’t attempt to gain access to another user’s account or data.</li>
            <li>O Don’t perform any attack that could harm the reliability/integrity of our services or data. DDoS/spam attacks are not allowed.</li>
            <li>O Don’t publicly disclose a bug before it has been fixed..</li>
            <li>O Allow a reasonable amount of time for Leetcode to respond to your vulnerability report before publishing details of your exploit</li>
            <li>O Only test for vulnerabilities on sites you know to be operated by Leetcode. Some sites hosted on subdomains of leetcode.com are either
                 operated by third parties or no longer supported by us and just there for legacy reasons. Though in case it's possible to escalate the
                  privileges through subdomain website to our original site, then it might be eligible for bug bounty.</li>
            <li>O Do not impact other users with your testing, this includes testing for vulnerabilities in repositories you do not own. We may
                 suspend your Leetcode account and ban your IP address if you do so.</li>
            <li>O Don’t use scanners, scrapers or any other automated tools in your testing. They’re noisy and we may suspend your Leetcode account and ban your IP address.</li>
            <li>O Never attempt non-technical attacks such as social engineering, phishing, or physical attacks against our employees, users, or infrastructure.</li>
            <li>O When in doubt, contact us at</li>
        </ul>





        <p class="text-black font-bold text-[18px] mt-[40px]">Rules for us</p>
