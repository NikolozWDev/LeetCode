                   <p class="text-black font-bold text-[18px] mt-[40px]">ACCOUNT DELETION</p>

                   <p class="text-gray-600 text-[16px]">You can request to delete your LeetCode Account anytime.
                     Before you proceed with the account deletion process, please read and fully understand the terms
                      related to account deletion. If you do not agree with the terms, please stop the deletion process
                       immediately.
                       </p>




                       <p class="text-black font-bold text-[18px] mt-[40px]">About deleting your LeetCode account:</p>

                       <p class="text-gray-600 text-[16px]">1. Once you request to delete your LeetCode account,
                         you will enter a 15-day cool-off period during which we will preserve your data but it will
                          not be visible to other users. You can retrieve your account anytime by logging back into
                           LeetCode within the cool-off period.
                           </p>


                           <p class="text-gray-600 text-[16px]">2. If an account is permanently deleted after the
                            cool-off period, such deletion is irreversible, and you will not regain access. All
                             third-party accounts connected to this deleted account will be automatically disconnected,
                              and you will not be able to log in with these third-party accounts.
                              </p>


                              <p class="text-gray-600 text-[16px]">3. Upon deletion, you will lose access to all content,
                                 including information, data, and records associated with your account. You will lose access
                                  to all subscriptions and or/content you purchased with that account. You will not be able
                                   to recover or request to retrieve any account-related content or information, even if you
                                    register and use LeetCode again with the same user name or email address.
                                  </p>

                                  <p class="text-gray-600 text-[16px]">4. Some content, such as comments or posts you made
                                     in the community, may remain visible to other users after your account deletion, but this
                                      information will be displayed anonymously.
                                      </p>

                                      <p class="text-gray-600 text-[16px]">5. Once you agree to delete, the relevant
                                         terms of service and other rights with LeetCode will terminate accordingly,
                                          except for those that have been agreed to continue in effective or as otherwise
                                           prescribed by laws and regulations. You will also no longer enjoy the user rights
                                            outlined in the "Privacy Policy," except as otherwise mandated by laws and regulations
                                             or required by regulatory authorities.
